# SciCompGroup8
Scientific Computing course assignments. Group consist of: Liesbet Ooghe, Frederieke Loth, Kushnava Singha

# Contents
mask_method.py - Contains the main simulation for diffusion with a mask.
iteration_methods.py - Implements various numerical methods for solving diffusion equations.
vibrating_string.py - Defines the VibratingString class for simulating wave propagation on a string.
visualisation.py - Contains functions to visualize the results of the simulations, including animations of vibrating strings and concentration fields.
run_code.ipynb - This notebook runs the code neccesary for answering the assignment questions.

# Requirements
The code was run on Python 3.12 
Libraries Numpy, Matplotlib and Scipy

# Usage
By running the run_code.ipynb you can run the neccesary code. Please note that some cells may run for longer than 5 minutes.

# Results
After running the simulations, you can visualize the results as animations or plots of concentration fields. The program also allows comparing different numerical methods, such as Explicit, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR, to analyze their convergence rates.

# Conclusion
This project provides tools for simulating diffusion processes on 2D grids with varying boundary conditions and simulating the dynamics of a vibrating string. The visualizations offer a clear understanding of how the diffusion evolves over time and how waves propagate on a string.
